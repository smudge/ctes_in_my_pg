# CtesInMyPg

[postgres_ext][1], a great gem, does not support Rails 5 yet.  

Since I only ever use [CTEs][2] from that gem, I thought I'd rip out the code for that and put it in a separate gem to get CTEs working with Rails & ActiveRecord 5.

***All credit goes to [Dan McClain][3] and the postgres_ext contributors*** ... I just stole the code ... though I did remove `alias_method_chain`!

[Now supports Rails 6!](https://github.com/kmurph73/ctes_in_my_pg/pull/4)

```ruby
gem 'ctes_in_my_pg', github: 'kmurph73/ctes_in_my_pg'
```

# Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

ctes_in_my_pg adds CTE expression support to ActiveRecord via:

  * [`Relation#with`](#with)

## with

We can add CTEs to queries by chaining `#with` off a relation.
`Relation#with` accepts a hash, and will convert `Relation`s to the
proper SQL in the CTE.

Let's expand a `#with` call to its resulting SQL code:

```ruby
Score.with(my_games: Game.where(id: 1)).joins('JOIN my_games ON scores.game_id = my_games.id')
```

The following will be generated when that relation is evaluated:

```SQL
WITH my_games AS (
SELECT games.*
FROM games
WHERE games.id = 1
)
SELECT *
FROM scores
JOIN my_games
ON scores.games_id = my_games.id
```

You can also do a recursive with:

```ruby
Graph.with.recursive(search_graph:
  "  SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1 AS depth
     FROM graph g
   UNION ALL
     SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1
     FROM graph g, search_graph sg
     WHERE g.id = sg.link").from(:search_graph)
```

Starting with PostgreSQL 12 and above, you can specify `MATERIALIZED` and `NOT MATERIALIZED` specifiers to control the materialization of CTEs. You can use these specifiers like so:

```ruby
Foo.with.materialized(this_is_materialized: Foo.my_scope)
  .with.not_materialized(this_is_not_materialized: Foo.another_scope)
```

When using PostgreSQL 12 and above, `MATERIALIZED` and `NOT MATERIALIZED` will be added to the CTEs. In the case of versions of PostgreSQL prior to 12, no specifiers will be added, as those keywords did not exist and all CTEs were materialized by default.

## no Model.from_cte

no support for postgre_ext's [from_cte](https://github.com/DockYard/postgres_ext/blob/master/docs/querying.md#from_cte) because I couldn't get it working and I don't really see the point of it anyway

PRs for `from_cte` support are of course welcome however

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ctes_in_my_pg', github: 'kmurph73/ctes_in_my_pg'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. 

To run the tests, create a PG db then put `DATABASE_URL="postgres://[YOUR_USERNAME]:@localhost/somedb"` in .env.  Then run `bundle exec rake db:migrate`.

Then, run `bundle exec rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
